9.1 MyDiary does not transmit (and thus cannot store) any answers/information/data outside the boundaries of the storage accessed by the device.

9.2 Upon clicking the submit answers button within MyDiary you will be presented with a dialog/popup informing you that the answers inputted into the current active/running MyDiary application instance, will be saved and submitted. After confirming the Submit answers dialog,  your answers will be compressed and saved/stored onto the external storage on your device under a folder named “MyDiary_data”. A request to open the Gmail client with this compressed file attached will then be subsequently performed. When you agree to this EULA you understand and accept that at this point (post confirmation of the Submit answers dialog) you are solely responsible for any action you choose to make regarding the answers that have been saved, and/or any other data: i.e. sending an email from third party applications (such as the Gmail). You also understand and agree that the Providers take no responsibility with regards to the process of actually transmitting any data, and that any data you do transmit is done so at your own risk.
